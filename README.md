# GUI Framework for ROV Control

This repository documents a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Qt, specifically designed to control a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The primary focus of the project was to implement advanced vision-based functionalities to assist in underwater operations.

## Key Contributions

### Vision System Development

- **Object Measurement**: Implemented algorithms to calculate the dimensions and density of underwater objects using camera feeds. This involved processing image data and applying geometric transformations.
- **Shape Recognition**: Designed and developed methods to detect and recognize geometric shapes such as circles, squares, and rectangles in real-time. This functionality allows the system to count and classify objects effectively.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrated the vision outputs into the GUI, ensuring seamless interaction between the user and the visual data. Custom overlays and indicators were added to enhance usability.

### GUI Design

- Developed an intuitive interface for controlling the ROV, including joystick inputs and real-time feedback from the ROV's sensors and cameras.
- Integrated Qt widgets and custom components to display live video feeds, telemetry data, and vision analysis results.

### System Integration

- Ensured seamless communication between the ROV's hardware and the GUI application, using protocols to transmit vision and control data efficiently.
- Optimized the performance of the GUI to handle high-resolution video streams and real-time processing without noticeable latency.

## Features

- **ROV Control Interface**: A user-friendly interface for precise maneuvering of the ROV in underwater environments.
- **Advanced Vision Capabilities**: Real-time processing for object measurement, density calculations, and shape recognition.
- **Modular Design**: The vision and control components are decoupled, allowing for easy extension and adaptation to other ROV systems.
